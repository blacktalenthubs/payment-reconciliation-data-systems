## Requirements & Scope
 **Business Needs**  
   - Reconcile daily (or hourly) financial transactions among multiple external (banks, card networks) and internal systems.  
   - Generate a consolidated “Ledger Reference Index” for finance teams to query, analyze, and audit data.  
   - Ensure high data accuracy, completeness, and compliance readiness.

**Functional Requirements**  
   - Ingest and unify heterogeneous transaction data formats (CSV, JSON, custom bank formats).  
   - Validate and reconcile entries from various sources (internal vs. external) with minimal data drift.  
   - Provide near real-time or scheduled (e.g., daily 2 AM) completion for settlement.  
   - Enable robust data lineage and auditing for compliance.

**Non-Functional Requirements**  
   - **Performance**: Handle millions of transaction records daily.  
   - **Scalability**: Scale compute and storage for peak loads (month-end, year-end).  
   - **Reliability**: Highly fault-tolerant ingestion and transformation pipelines.  
   - **Data Governance**: Schema evolution, metadata management, strict versioning, and auditing.

---

## High-Level Architecture Overview
**Data Lake / Landing Zone**  
   - All raw extracts from banks, card networks, and internal transaction logs land in a secure, centralized object store (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake, or GCS).  
   - Each source has its own partitioned path structure (by date, region, etc.).

**Batch Processing Layer**  
   - Use a distributed compute engine (e.g., Apache Spark) running on an orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes or EMR).  
   - Transformation jobs parse, cleanse, and unify formats, creating a structured output (Parquet tables or Delta tables).

**Reconciliation Logic & Index Generation**  
   - Reconciliation jobs match incoming transactions from external networks against internal ledgers.  
   - Aggregated output is written to a “Ledger Reference Index” (could be a relational DB for strong consistency or a specialized index store).  
   - Periodic “snapshots” are taken for compliance and auditing.

**Downstream Consumption**  
   - Finance dashboards and reporting tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) connect to the ledger index.  
   - Audit teams can run cross-checks or drill-down queries on historical snapshots.  

---

## Data Ingestion & Transformation
**Extract & Load**  
   - Scheduled batch jobs read new files from external banks, card networks, etc.  
   - Ingestion code tracks file completeness, rejects malformed files, and raises alerts.

**Data Normalization**  
   - Common schema mapping ensures that each transaction record has uniform fields (e.g., transaction_id, timestamp, amount, currency, fees).  
   - Apply transformations for currency conversions, time zone adjustments, etc.

**Deduplication & Late Data Handling**  
   - Use Spark jobs (or similar) to detect duplicate transaction IDs or partial updates.  
   - Maintain a reference dictionary (keyed by transaction_id) to handle re-processed records or late-arriving corrections from banks.

**Validation & QA**  
   - Automated rule checks (e.g., transaction amounts > 0, currency codes valid).  
   - Log anomalies to a “quarantine” area for manual investigation.

---

## Reconciliation Logic
**Matching & Exception Handling**  
   - Compare external transactions (bank statements) against internal system-of-record logs.  
   - Flag mismatches (e.g., missing entries, amount discrepancies, duplicates).  
   - Generate exception reports for finance teams to investigate disputes.

**Fee & Refund Calculation**  
   - Integrate business logic to handle interchange fees, network fees, refunds, and adjustments.  
   - Summaries at multiple levels (network-level, bank-level, merchant-level).

**Partial & Delayed Updates**  
   - Support re-running the reconciliation job with partial or late data.  
   - Maintain multiple “runs” or “versions” of a day’s settlement until it is finalized.

**Auditable Trails**  
   - Keep a detailed log of match attempts, unmatched records, and reasons for mismatch.  
   - Store these logs in a dedicated S3/Blob container for future reference.

---

## Ledger Reference Index Generation
**Storage Layer**  
   - **Relational DB** (e.g., PostgreSQL) if strong consistency and relational queries are top priority.  
   - **NoSQL / Specialized Index** (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch) if high-volume read queries and flexible query patterns are required.

**Schema & Partitioning**  
   - Partition by date or settlement batch for efficient lookups and archiving.  
   - Ensure indexes on key columns (transaction_id, status, mismatch_flag).

**Snapshotting & Versioning**  
   - Daily or hourly snapshots stored in a “history” schema/table to provide point-in-time reconciliation.  
   - Allows easy rollback or re-check for disputes raised days/weeks later.

**Access & Security**  
   - Fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) for finance, audit, and engineering teams.  
   - Potential integration with a data catalog or governance platform for compliance tagging.

---

## Infrastructure Rollout & Deployment
**Compute Cluster**  
   - Kubernetes or Yarn-based Spark clusters that auto-scale based on the size of daily loads.  
   - Spot instances or ephemeral worker nodes for cost optimization.

**Storage Services**  
   - Object storage (S3/ADLS/GCS) for raw/processed data.  
   - Relational or NoSQL database with multi-AZ (Availability Zone) or multi-region replication for high availability.

**Orchestration & Scheduling**  
   - Use Airflow/Argo Workflows to schedule and manage daily batch pipelines.  
   - DAGs define each stage: ingestion -> transformation -> reconciliation -> indexing -> QA -> publish.

**Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)**  
   - Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated build/test of Spark jobs.  
   - Canary or staged deployment of new ETL code to dev/test/prod environments.

---

## Deployment Plans & Testing
**Environments**  
   - **Dev**: Small subset of data, used for rapid iteration.  
   - **Staging**: Larger sample of near-production data for end-to-end tests, performance checks.  
   - **Production**: Full dataset, governed by strict SLAs.

**Testing Strategy**  
   - **Unit Tests**: Validate transformation logic (dedup, conversions).  
   - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end runs using realistic input data across multiple sources.  
   - **Performance & Stress Tests**: Evaluate scaling behavior for peak loads.  
   - **Acceptance Tests**: Finance teams or QA sign off before production promotion.

**Deployment Flow**  
   - Merge code into main branch -> Automated test suites -> Build container images -> Deploy to staging -> Validation -> Promote to production.

**Rollback Mechanisms**  
   - Versioned ETL jobs and reproducible pipeline configurations.  
   - Ability to re-run the last known stable pipeline if new logic fails or introduces data issues.

---

## Observability & Production Runbook
**Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - Metrics on pipeline duration, data throughput, and error rates.  
   - Alerts for SLA breaches (e.g., pipeline not done by 2 AM), mismatches above normal thresholds.

**Logging & Tracing**  
   - Centralized log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack) for Spark driver/executor logs and system logs.  
   - Distributed tracing for investigating slow tasks or data bottlenecks.

**Data Validation Checks**  
   - Automated checks on sums of credits vs. debits, expected record counts, or suspicious anomaly spikes.  
   - If critical thresholds are exceeded, pipeline fails fast or triggers manual review.

**Runbook Procedures**  
   - Steps to handle pipeline retries or partial reprocessing.  
   - Escalation paths to finance teams if mismatch volumes are above normal.  
   - Backup/restore procedures for ledger DB or index store.

---

## Key Design Choices & Challenges
**Trade-Off: RDBMS vs. NoSQL for the Ledger Store**  
   - **RDBMS**: Better for structured queries, ACID guarantees, but may struggle with very large scale.  
   - **NoSQL**: High read/write throughput but less strict consistency—requires careful schema design.

**Schema Evolution**  
   - Must accommodate additional transaction fields, new fee types, or advanced reporting needs.  
   - Use a meta-store or schema registry (e.g., Hive Metastore) for versioning.

**Late-Arriving & Partial Data**  
   - Adopt a multi-run approach for each settlement period until final data is confirmed.  
   - Archive intermediate states for auditing.

**Performance vs. Cost Optimization**  
   - Balance ephemeral cluster scaling (to handle peak loads quickly) vs. cost overhead.  
   - Evaluate reserved or spot instances on cloud providers.

---

## ML Extension
**Anomaly Detection**  
   - Train models on historical transactions to spot abnormal volumes or mismatch rates.  
   - Integration into the pipeline to label suspicious records or trigger alerts in real time.

**Forecasting**  
   - Predict daily or hourly transaction volumes, fees, or future mismatches to optimize resource allocation.  
   - Helps finance teams plan liquidity and reserve thresholds.

**Implementation**  
   - Use Spark ML or a separate Python-based pipeline (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) orchestrated by Airflow.  
   - Store output predictions or anomaly flags in the ledger index for immediate follow-up.

**Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Payment Data & Fraud Signals Platform**

---

### Overview

This platform ingests and processes payment data and fraud signals in both **real-time** (streaming) and **batch** modes. The goal is to generate an **enriched, indexed output** that serves downstream consumers, such as payment gateway systems, risk analytics teams, and other enterprise services (e.g., reporting, customer service portals).

**Key Highlights**  
- **Upstream Inputs**:  
  - Real-time transaction streams (e.g., from POS or online checkout).  
  - Batch exports of historical payment data.  
  - Fraud signals output by ML models.  
  - Policy control data that changes infrequently (batch lookups).  
- **Downstream Consumers**:  
  - Payment gateway systems needing near real-time authorization decisions.  
  - ML systems that train on historical + near real-time data for enhanced fraud detection.  
  - Risk and compliance teams using an aggregated fraud index for investigations or audits.  
  - Additional enterprise services that leverage the enriched index (e.g., analytics, reporting).  
- **Mixed Deployment Patterns**:  
  - **Streaming Pipeline**: Ingests real-time payments, merges with fraud signals, outputs a “Live Index.”  
  - **Batch Pipeline**: Processes historical data, merges with policy data, outputs a “Batch Index.”  
  - Both indexes are ultimately joined into a consolidated “Aggregate Index” for consistent downstream use.

---

### Functional Requirements

1. **(BR1) Real-Time Payment Ingestion**  
   - The system must capture live transactions from payment gateways (or POS systems) in sub-second latency.  
   - It should enrich each transaction with immediate fraud signals (e.g., rule-based flags, ML-derived risk scores).  

2. **(BR2) Batch Historical Processing**  
   - The system must support daily or periodic batch ingestion of large historical payment datasets.  
   - It should apply deduplication, transformations, and integrate policy control data that updates infrequently.  

3. **(BR3) Fraud Signal Integration**  
   - The system must integrate ML-generated fraud signals (e.g., suspicious activity scores) and incorporate them into both real-time and batch pipelines.  
   - It should provide a feedback loop for ML models, so new data can be used to retrain or refine fraud detection algorithms.  

4. **(BR4) Indexed Output for Risk & Compliance**  
   - The system must output an index (or set of indexed tables) that can be queried in near real-time by risk teams.  
   - These indexes should store transaction details, associated risk scores, and relevant policy flags.  

5. **(BR5) Mixed Deployment Pattern**  
   - The system must run two distinct deployment flows: one for streaming ingestion (and continuous updates) and one for batch ingestion (and scheduled updates).  
   - Both outputs (Stream Index + Batch Index) must be merged to produce a single “Aggregate Index” accessible to downstreams.  

6. **(BR6) Downstream Data Delivery & Consumption**  
   - The system must publish the enriched data to:  
     - Payment gateway services (e.g., for final authorization checks).  
     - ML pipelines (for further modeling and scoring).  
     - BI/analytics platforms (for dashboards, compliance reporting).  

7. **(BR7) Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - The system must include real-time monitoring of ingestion, processing latencies, error rates, and fraud score anomalies.  
   - Critical alerts (e.g., pipeline downtime, abnormal spikes in fraud scores) must notify on-call teams immediately.

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**  
  - The streaming pipeline should process and index transactions with sub-second latency for time-sensitive decisions.  
  - The batch pipeline must handle large volumes (millions of records) within scheduled SLAs.

- **Scalability**  
  - Must auto-scale to handle variable transaction loads (e.g., seasonal spikes).  
  - Should accommodate future growth in data volumes (transaction expansions, new fraud signals).

- **Reliability & Availability**  
  - Must provide high uptime for critical payment workflows.  
  - Implement fault tolerance and recovery strategies (e.g., checkpointing in streaming, retry logic for batch).

- **Security & Compliance**  
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive payment and personal information.  
  - Strict role-based access control to comply with PCI-DSS and other regulatory standards.

- **Data Quality & Governance**  
  - Enforce schema validation and data integrity checks for both streaming and batch inputs.  
  - Maintain an audit trail of data transformations and changes to fraud scores.

- **Maintainability**  
  - Clear separation of streaming vs. batch code, with reusable libraries for data transformations.  
  - Automated CI/CD pipelines for frequent updates and safe rollouts.

- **Monitoring & Observability**  
  - Centralized logging, metrics, and dashboards to track streaming throughput, batch job times, and error counts.  
  - Real-time alerts on SLA breaches or unusual fraud activity.

---

### System Description

The platform comprises two major pipelines that produce two separate indexes—**Live Index** (real-time) and **Batch Index**—which are ultimately joined into an **Aggregate Index**. The pipelines incorporate both **payment data** and **fraud signals**, plus **policy data** in batch form. Downstream services (payment gateway, risk & compliance portals, ML training jobs) retrieve the enriched data via low-latency queries or scheduled exports.
