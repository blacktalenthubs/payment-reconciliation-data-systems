Below are **ten common performance and latency problems** you might encounter when running Spark-based data pipelines at scale, along with **detailed solutions** for each. Afterward, we provide a **refactored pipeline outline** showing how to incorporate these solutions and configurations.

# 10 Performance & Latency Problems in Spark Data Systems

## 1) Data Skew  
**Problem**: Some keys (e.g., a particular `user_id` or `merchant_id`) can appear far more frequently than others, causing one or a few executors to process a disproportionate amount of data. This leads to uneven workloads and extended job times.  
**Solution**:  
- **Salting**: Add random suffixes to the skewed key. For instance, if `merchant_id = M-12345` is heavily skewed, create a composite key `(merchant_id, random_salt)` to distribute data more evenly.  
- **Adaptive Execution**: Spark’s Adaptive Query Execution can detect skew at runtime and split large partitions automatically (Spark 3+).  
- **Repartition with a custom partitioner**: If you know the distribution, you can create a partitioner that flattens out the skew.  

## 2) Excessive Shuffle & Shuffle File Overhead  
**Problem**: Spark shuffle operations (e.g., for wide joins, groupBy, distinct) cause data to be redistributed across the cluster. If these operations occur frequently, the overhead of writing shuffle files to disk can degrade performance.  
**Solution**:  
- **Minimize Wide Operations**: Where possible, reduce the number of wide transformations (e.g., combine multiple joins into a single multi-join).  
- **Cache Reused Data**: If you must reuse the same joined data, cache it in memory or on disk to avoid repeated shuffles.  
- **Consolidate Shuffle**: Spark 3’s `spark.shuffle.push.enabled` can help in specific cluster setups. Also ensure you have adequate shuffle service memory or SSD-based shuffle directories.

## 3) Tiny Partitions & Task Overhead  
**Problem**: If you have thousands of small files or an excessive number of partitions (e.g., 50,000 partitions for a moderate dataset), Spark ends up spawning too many tasks, each doing minimal work, causing overhead in task scheduling and coordination.  
**Solution**:  
- **Repartition or Coalesce**: Before writing Parquet, use a reasonable `repartition(N)` or `coalesce(N)` to produce fewer, larger files.  
- **Auto-Optimize**: Tools like Databricks Auto Optimize or AWS Glue can merge small files automatically, but you can also do a final step in your pipeline to combine them.

## 4) Very Large Partitions Causing Executor Out-of-Memory  
**Problem**: Opposite of tiny partitions—if you have too few partitions, each partition might be enormous. One or two executors could run out of memory during shuffles or join stages.  
**Solution**:  
- **Tune Partition Count**: Aim for partitions sized between ~128 MB and ~512 MB (depending on your cluster). Typically, `4 × number_of_cores_in_cluster` is a decent starting heuristic.  
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Enable Spark’s dynamic allocation so it can adjust executors based on data volume.

## 5) Under-Provisioned Executors & Poor Resource Utilization  
**Problem**: If each executor is assigned too little memory (`spark.executor.memory`) or too many CPU cores, you can get GC overhead or CPU contention.  
**Solution**:  
- **Fine-tune Executor Sizing**: Follow the “one core → ~4-6 GB memory” heuristic. Don’t give an executor 32 cores with only 16 GB memory, or you’ll see heavy GC.  
- **Monitor GC & CPU**: Use Spark UI or metrics to see if tasks are starved for CPU or causing frequent garbage collection.

## 6) Inefficient Joins (Unnecessary Broadcast or Large Sort-Merge Joins)  
**Problem**: Large sort-merge joins across massive data sets can be slow, or inadvertently broadcasting a 1 GB dimension table can blow memory.  
**Solution**:  
- **Use Broadcast Joins Wisely**: Only broadcast truly small dimension tables (< a few hundred MB).  
- **Skew Hints**: Spark has `/*+ SKEW('join') */` hints in Spark SQL if certain keys are known to cause skew.  
- **Incremental or single-pass multi-joins**: If the same large table is joined multiple times, do a single pass multi-join with common dimension references.

## 7) Slow Data Reads from External Storage (S3, HDFS, Kafka)  
**Problem**: Bottlenecks in I/O can hamper throughput. E.g., reading from S3 with too few parallel streams or from Kafka with insufficient partitions.  
**Solution**:  
- **Increase Kafka Partitions**: If you have 2 partitions for 1 TB of data, you’ll be severely limited. More partitions = more concurrency.  
- **Parallel S3 Reads**: Use `spark.hadoop.mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize` or `split.maxsize` to ensure splits are sized well.  
- **Optimize S3 Access**: If using Hive partitions, store data in partitioned directories. Potentially enable `s3a.fast.upload`.

## 8) High Network Overhead in Executor Communication  
**Problem**: If the cluster is in multi-AZ or cross-region scenarios, or executors are saturating network bandwidth with large shuffles, you can see major slowdowns.  
**Solution**:  
- **Data Locality**: Where possible, keep the cluster in one region or AZ.  
- **Tune Spark Network Buffers**: Increase `spark.network.timeout`, `spark.rpc.message.maxSize`, etc., if big data blocks cause overhead.  
- **Consider More Powerful Instances**: In AWS, use instance types with higher network bandwidth for shuffle-heavy workloads.

## 9) Unnecessary “Wide” Format in Kafka or JSON Causing Heavy Parsing  
**Problem**: If your Kafka messages or JSON data have a huge nested structure, Spark invests significant CPU in parsing. This can be a big overhead for every micro-batch or partition.  
**Solution**:  
- **Use Efficient Formats**: For streaming, keep messages small and typed if possible (Avro or Protobuf). For batch, prefer Parquet.  
- **Project Only Required Columns**: Use Spark’s `select()` or schema pruning so you don’t parse or load columns you don’t need.

## 10) Lack of Proper Checkpointing & State Management in Streaming  
**Problem**: If your structured streaming job does stateful operations (e.g., aggregations over time windows) but has suboptimal checkpointing or no checkpoint location, restarts cause reprocessing, overhead, or data duplication.  
**Solution**:  
- **Enable Checkpointing**: Always set `checkpointLocation` with enough storage.  
- **Shorten State Windows**: If your window is too large, Spark must keep enormous state in memory. Breaking it up can speed processing.  
- **State TTL**: If partial aggregates are no longer needed after X hours/days, set a state timeout to free memory.

# Refactoring the Pipelines for Performance

Below is a **summary** of how we can adapt our previously provided scripts to mitigate these issues. Rather than rewriting each script line by line, we’ll highlight key modifications.

## 1) Optimal Partitioning & Minimizing Shuffle

- **Control partition count**: 
  ```python
  spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
  ```
  to avoid default 200-20,000 partitions.  
- **Combine multiple joins** into a single chain or multi-join step if they reference the same main table.  

**Example**:  
```python
# Instead of:
joined_tx_fraud = tx_df.join(fraud_df, "transaction_id")
joined_user = joined_tx_fraud.join(user_dim, "user_id")
joined_merchant = joined_user.join(merchant_dim, "merchant_id")

# Combine them:
df = (tx_df
      .join(fraud_df, "transaction_id")
      .join(user_dim, "user_id")
      .join(merchant_dim, "merchant_id", "left")
      .join(policy_dim, "policy_id", "left")
      .join(riskrule_dim, df["reason_code"] == riskrule_dim["rule_id"], "left"))
```
This condenses multiple shuffles into fewer stages.

## 2) Avoid Overly Large or Small Partitions

- **Post-processing**: When writing Parquet, coalesce or repartition to a moderate number of output files:
  ```python
  final_df = final_df.repartition(50)  # or coalesce(50)
  final_df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("...")
  ```

## 3) Memory & Executor Configuration

- **Example**:  
  ```bash
  spark-submit \
    --master yarn \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --conf spark.executor.memory=8g \
    --conf spark.executor.cores=2 \
    --conf spark.executor.instances=10 \
    ...
  ```
  This ensures a total of 20 cores, each with ~8 GB memory = 160 GB total, a balanced approach for typical mid-scale jobs.

## 4) Data Skew Handling

- If you suspect `merchant_id` is skewed, **salting** can help:
  ```python
  from pyspark.sql.functions import expr

  # Create a salt column with a small random integer
  salted_df = df.withColumn("salt", (F.rand() * 10).cast("int"))
  # Then join on (merchant_id, salt) if the dimension is also salted in a similar manner.
  ```

## 5) Kafka Partitioning

- If reading from Kafka, ensure enough partitions. Instead of 3 partitions for a large dataset, create 30 or more. This is an ops-level fix (Kafka config), but crucial for concurrency.

## 6) Enabling Adaptive Query Execution

- In Spark 3+, we can enable:
  ```python
  spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
  spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.reducePostShufflePartitions.enabled", "true")
  ```
  This helps reduce shuffle partitions if it sees a large amount of empty tasks or automatically handle skew.

## 7) Checking “timestamp” as Real Timestamp

- Converting strings to timestamps frequently can hamper performance. Instead, store data as a proper `TimestampType`, which speeds up comparisons and ordering.

## 8) Minimizing Files on S3 / Merging Small Files

- Add a final step to merge small files if you have thousands:
  ```python
  # after writing the final index:
  final_agg_df = spark.read.parquet(FINAL_INDEX_OUTPUT)
  final_agg_df.coalesce(20).write.mode("overwrite").parquet(FINAL_INDEX_OUTPUT + "_merged")
  ```
  Then rename or move the merged data to replace the old data.

## 9) Minimizing Unnecessary Wide Transformations

- If you only need certain columns, **select** them early. Don’t do `df.select("*")` if only half the columns are used. This reduces data volume in memory and across the network.

## 10) State & Checkpoint Tuning for Streaming

- If the pipeline has structured streaming aggregates, ensure you set:
  ```python
  .option("checkpointLocation", "s3://my-bucket/checkpoints/streaming_job/")
  .trigger(processingTime="20 seconds")
  ```
  and consider short windows or a state TTL if the aggregator is time-based:
  ```python
  spark.conf.set("spark.sql.streaming.statefulOperator.checkpointLocation", "...")
  spark.conf.set("spark.sql.streaming.statefulOperator.stateExpireAfterAccess", "24h")
  ```

# Example: Refactored Streaming Pipeline (Snippet)

Here’s an **illustrative snippet** for **streaming_index.py** that applies some performance recommendations:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession, functions as F
from schemas import (
    TransactionSchema, FraudSignalSchema,
    UserSchema, MerchantSchema, PolicySchema, RiskRuleSchema
)

def main():
    spark = (SparkSession.builder
             .appName("StreamingIndexJob")
             # 1) Tuning shuffle partitions
             .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
             # 2) Adaptive Execution
             .config("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
             .config("spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.reducePostShufflePartitions.enabled", "true")
             .getOrCreate())

    # 3) Balanced logging level
    spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("WARN")

    # Reading from Kafka
    tx_raw = spark.readStream.format("kafka") \
        .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092") \
        .option("subscribe", "transactions_topic") \
        .option("startingOffsets", "latest") \
        .load()

    # Parse only needed columns
    tx_df = tx_raw.select(
        F.from_json(F.col("value").cast("string"), TransactionSchema).alias("t")
    ).select("t.*",
             # If we only need these columns for further ops
             "t.transaction_id",
             "t.user_id",
             "t.merchant_id",
             "t.timestamp",
             "t.amount",
             "t.policy_id"
    )

    # Same logic for fraud signals
    fraud_raw = spark.readStream.format("kafka") \
        .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092") \
        .option("subscribe", "fraud_signals_topic") \
        .option("startingOffsets", "latest") \
        .load()

    fraud_df = fraud_raw.select(
        F.from_json(F.col("value").cast("string"), FraudSignalSchema).alias("f")
    ).select("f.*")

    # Single pass multi-join
    user_dim = spark.read.schema(UserSchema).parquet("path/to/user_dim.parquet")
    merchant_dim = spark.read.schema(MerchantSchema).parquet("path/to/merchant_dim.parquet")
    policy_dim = spark.read.schema(PolicySchema).parquet("path/to/policy_dim.parquet")
    riskrule_dim = spark.read.schema(RiskRuleSchema).parquet("path/to/riskrule_dim.parquet")

    joined_df = (tx_df
                 .join(fraud_df, "transaction_id", "inner")
                 .join(user_dim, "user_id", "inner")
                 .join(merchant_dim, "merchant_id", "inner")
                 .join(policy_dim, "policy_id", "left")
                 .join(riskrule_dim, fraud_df["reason_code"] == riskrule_dim["rule_id"], "left"))

    # Repartition if needed for large volumes
    # joined_df = joined_df.repartition(200)

    # Write out the streaming index
    query = (joined_df.writeStream
             .format("parquet")
             .option("path", "path/to/streaming_index.parquet")
             .option("checkpointLocation", "path/to/checkpoints/streaming_index")
             .outputMode("append")
             .trigger(processingTime="10 seconds")
             .start())

    query.awaitTermination()
    spark.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**What changed**:  
- We consolidated **all dimension joins** into a single chain.  
- We explicitly **set** shuffle partitions to 200 (instead of default 200-20k).  
- We **enabled** adaptive query execution.  
- We used **select()** to project only needed columns.  
- We left out broadcasting for now (that’s an optimization step we’d consider carefully).
