## Data Shuffle

1. **Definition**:  
   A _shuffle_ happens in Spark when data must be **redistributed** across the cluster—for example, when you do a `groupBy()`, `join()`, or `repartition()`. Spark needs to send partial data from some executors to others so that rows with the same key end up on the same partition.

2. **Example**:  
   Suppose you have 100,000 transaction rows spread across 10 partitions, and you run a `groupBy("merchant_id")` in Spark. Spark will gather all rows that belong to a specific `merchant_id` into the same partition so it can compute the group-by.  
   - If you had 10 executors, Spark will shuffle these 100,000 rows: each executor sends some rows out and also receives some rows from other executors, to ensure rows with the same merchant_id land together.

3. **Costs**:  
   - **Network I/O**: Data is serialized and transferred across the network or from disk.  
   - **Disk I/O**: Shuffle files are written/read from local disk on executors.  
   - **Coordination**: Spark must manage map outputs and track how data is moved.  

4. **Why it happens**:  
   Because you’re doing a _wide transformation_ that requires re-grouping or re-partitioning data by some key.

## Data Skew

1. **Definition**:  
   _Data skew_ occurs when the distribution of rows across keys is **not uniform**. In a groupBy or join scenario, one or a few keys might have far more rows than others, causing certain partitions (executors) to handle **much larger** data volumes and slow down the entire job.

2. **Example**:  
   - Suppose you have 3 merchants: Merchant A, Merchant B, and Merchant C.  
   - **In a healthy distribution**: Each merchant might have ~33,333 transactions if you have 100,000 total transactions. So when Spark groups by `merchant_id`, it’s fairly balanced (each partition handles about 33,333 rows).  
   - **In a skewed distribution**: Maybe Merchant A has 90,000 transactions, while Merchants B and C have only 5,000 each. When you do a `groupBy("merchant_id")`, all 90,000 rows for Merchant A will end up on the same partition (or same small set of partitions), while the others remain small.  

3. **Why this is a problem**:  
   - That partition (handling Merchant A’s 90,000 rows) will take significantly longer to finish because it’s processing a lot more data, while other partitions with small keys finish quickly.  
   - Spark’s stage can only move to the next step once **all** partitions finish, so the entire job is bottlenecked by that one partition.  

4. **Relation to Shuffle**:  
   - Spark shuffle is the mechanism redistributing data so that “like keys” group together. **Data skew** is a _distribution_ problem: when we do that shuffle, we end up with one or a few partitions containing vastly more data than others.  
   - You can have “normal” overhead from shuffles, but if there’s also skew, that overhead gets worse because a single partition (or a few partitions) becomes a bottleneck.

## Simplified Walkthrough Example

### Setup
- You have a dataset: 100,000 transaction rows.  
- Three merchants: **Merchant A**, **Merchant B**, **Merchant C**.

### Case 1: Balanced distribution
- \( \text{Merchant A} \) has 34,000 transactions  
- \( \text{Merchant B} \) has 33,000 transactions  
- \( \text{Merchant C} \) has 33,000 transactions  

When Spark does a `groupBy("merchant_id")`:
1. Spark triggers a _shuffle_ to bring rows of Merchant A, B, C together.  
2. Partition #1 might get all A’s rows (~34,000), Partition #2 might get B’s (~33,000), Partition #3 might get C’s (~33,000).  
3. The total sizes are roughly equal, so each partition finishes around the same time.

### Case 2: Skewed distribution
- \( \text{Merchant A} \) has 90,000 transactions  
- \( \text{Merchant B} \) has 5,000 transactions  
- \( \text{Merchant C} \) has 5,000 transactions  

Now, doing a `groupBy("merchant_id")`:
1. Spark again shuffles data.  
2. Partition #1 might end up with 90,000 rows for Merchant A, while Partition #2 and #3 each only have 5,000 for B/C.  
3. Partitions #2 and #3 finish quickly, but Partition #1 takes significantly longer to process those 90,000 rows.  
4. The overall job is slowed down because Spark waits for **all** partitions in that stage to complete.

Hence, the **shuffle** is just the mechanism for physically moving data (in any grouping or join). The **skew** is the logical problem of one or a few keys having a disproportionate amount of data, leading to partition imbalance and slowdown.

## Summary

- **Data Shuffle** is the act of redistributing data across partitions in Spark due to wide transformations (joins, groupBy, etc.). It always involves some overhead—network, disk, coordination.  
- **Data Skew** is a distribution problem where certain keys hold **far more** rows than others, causing one or a few partitions to become hotspots during or after a shuffle. This leads to uneven executor workloads and job bottlenecks.

When you see a job stuck at 90% completion with a few tasks taking forever, that’s often **data skew** (the shuffle is done, but one partition has a mountain of data). Avoiding or mitigating that skew is critical to keep performance consistent.
